        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I've started work on something I've wanted for years but never found anywhere in the wild: a recommendation engine that doesn't just show me more of the same. I want something that <em>nudges</em> me toward films and TV shows I'd never normally pick. Not the popular stuff, not the algorithmically obvious stuff - something far more personal, and a little bit&nbsp;unexpected.</p>
<p>For now, I'm calling it <strong>the Watchlist&nbsp;Project</strong>.</p>
<p>The basic features are what you'd expect. I'll be logging what I've watched, what I'm watching, and what I plan to watch. That gives me the raw data to chew on. But that isn't the grand idea. The real goal is to build a system that can form a kind of &quot;taste profile&quot; from that data - not a demographic caricature (&quot;you watched a sci-fi film, here are nine more sci-fi films&quot;) but a more nuanced sense of mood, tone, themes, pacing, emotional temperature, and the kinds of creative risks I tend to gravitate&nbsp;toward.</p>
<p>I want a system that can&nbsp;say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You gravitate toward character-driven stories with moral tension and a hint of cosmic unease. Try this obscure Norwegian gem from the 90s. Trust&nbsp;me.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Core Idea: A Taste Profile That Actually Means&nbsp;Something</h2>
<p>Instead of pigeonholing me into genres, the system will aim to capture things that&nbsp;matter&nbsp;more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mood and emotional&nbsp;temperature</li>
<li>Themes and ideas beneath the&nbsp;surface</li>
<li>Story structure and&nbsp;pacing</li>
<li>Creative risk and stylistic&nbsp;fingerprints</li>
<li>Patterns that aren't obvious but feel intuitive when&nbsp;surfaced</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal isn't &quot;more sci-fi because you watched sci-fi.&quot;<br />
The goal is &quot;here's something you never would have clicked on, but will absolutely&nbsp;enjoy.&quot;</p>
<h2>The Tech Behind the&nbsp;Scenes</h2>
<p>I spend most of my professional life in PHP and web development, so naturally that's where the backbone of this project starts. But I'll use whatever languages or tools are appropriate for the task at&nbsp;hand.</p>
<p>I'll be breaking the system architecture into the following&nbsp;stages.</p>
<h3>Data Ingestion&nbsp;Layer</h3>
<p>Pulling raw data from the&nbsp;following&nbsp;sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manual entries</strong> (films watched, in progress, want to&nbsp;watch)</li>
<li><strong>External APIs</strong> (TMDB&nbsp;primarily)</li>
<li><strong>Optional metadata sources</strong> (Letterboxd CSV export, IMDb ratings,&nbsp;etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The ingestion&nbsp;layer&nbsp;normalises:</p>
<ul>
<li>Titles</li>
<li>IDs</li>
<li>Genre&nbsp;tags</li>
<li>Cast/crew&nbsp;information</li>
<li>Keywords</li>
<li>Release&nbsp;data</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of it as a very opinionated ETL pipeline for metadata + user&nbsp;behaviour.</p>
<h3>Feature&nbsp;Extraction</h3>
<p>This is where the fun&nbsp;begins.</p>
<p>Potential features extracted&nbsp;per&nbsp;title:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thematic embeddings</strong> (using LLM/ML to generate a semantic vector for plot, tone, pacing)</li>
<li><strong>Crew signatures</strong> (directorial style, writer&nbsp;patterns)</li>
<li><strong>Narrative archetypes</strong> (hero's journey, anti-structure, character-driven&nbsp;drama)</li>
<li><strong>Genre/keyword&nbsp;weighting</strong></li>
<li><strong>Temporal features</strong> (era, runtime, production&nbsp;region)</li>
</ul>
<p>Potential features extracted&nbsp;per&nbsp;user:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taste-vector average</strong> (mean embedding of watched&nbsp;titles)</li>
<li><strong>Taste clusters</strong> (distinct &quot;modes&quot; of taste detected via&nbsp;clustering)</li>
<li><strong>Novelty tolerance</strong> (how far recommendations can deviate from known&nbsp;tastes)</li>
<li><strong>Serendipity bias</strong> (how often obscure or low-visibility titles should be&nbsp;surfaced)</li>
<li><strong>Diversity appetite</strong> (cross-genre, cross-era&nbsp;trends)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommendation&nbsp;Engine</h3>
<p>This is the core algorithmic component. Some early approaches&nbsp;under&nbsp;consideration:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vector similarity search</strong> across thematic embeddings (Cosine similarity on content embeddings rather than genre&nbsp;labels.)</li>
<li><strong>Weighted matrix factorisation</strong> - Not for ratings - more for interest likelihood based on behavioural&nbsp;patterns.</li>
<li><strong>&quot;Friction Distance&quot; Metric</strong> - A custom measure that defines how far a recommendation can safely stray from the user's tastes while still feeling&nbsp;relevant.</li>
<li><strong>Clustering-based discovery</strong> - If I have distinct clusters (e.g., &quot;slow sci-fi&quot; and &quot;British social realism&quot;), the engine should occasionally bridge the gap with hybrid or unexpected&nbsp;picks.</li>
</ul>
<p>This engine isn't trying to maximise watch-time. It aims for human-scale delight: the joy of discovering something that feels impossibly tailored yet&nbsp;surprising.</p>
<h3>Presentation&nbsp;Layer</h3>
<p>Initially a simple web&nbsp;app.&nbsp;Later:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personalised watchlist&nbsp;management</li>
<li>A recommendation&nbsp;feed</li>
<li>Title exploration&nbsp;pages</li>
<li>Taste-profile&nbsp;visualisations</li>
<li>A transparent &quot;why this recommendation?&quot;&nbsp;breakdown</li>
<li>Maybe even a public API or data&nbsp;export</li>
</ul>
<p>The interface is secondary to the idea, but still important. Discovery feels better when the UI feels like a curious companion rather than a corporate slot&nbsp;machine.</p>
<h2>Why Build This&nbsp;Myself?</h2>
<p>Because mainstream systems optimise for engagement, not discovery. Their goals aren't my&nbsp;goals.</p>
<p>I want recommendations&nbsp;that&nbsp;understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why I love <em>Waiting for Bojangles</em> and <em>Finding Nemo</em> in different&nbsp;ways</li>
<li>That my interest in 90s sci-fi doesn't mean I want more&nbsp;nostalgia</li>
<li>That my &quot;comfort watches&quot; don't define&nbsp;me</li>
<li>That I crave strange, small, forgotten films just as much as the big&nbsp;blockbusters</li>
</ul>
<p>The Watchlist Project is an attempt to build a tool that respects the weird knots of human&nbsp;taste.</p>
<h2>Why I'm Sharing&nbsp;This</h2>
<p>I want this blog to be more than a diary. By writing about the Watchlist&nbsp;Project&nbsp;publicly:</p>
<ul>
<li>I hope to attract <strong>collaborators or like-minded developers</strong> who might want to join the&nbsp;journey.</li>
<li>I want to show <strong>my thought process and skills</strong> in a way that's concrete and&nbsp;project-based.</li>
<li>And I want to <strong>document the evolution</strong> of a tech project from idea to execution, with all the mistakes, experiments, and breakthroughs along the&nbsp;way.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're curious about building something similar, enjoy following tech projects, or just love films as much as I do, I hope you follow along.</p>
<p>Stay tuned. There's a lot to build - and a lot to&nbsp;watch.</p>
